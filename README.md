# AutoCAD LI

AutoCAD LI is a tool that uses the List command and text files to extract Residential
block data. 

In your CAD File you will have a series of block (Hatched objects) and frontages (Usually polylines or just lines). 
When you select these objects in order and enter the List command AutoCAD will 
present a bunch of information about the objects including their lenth and area. 
This software will then print to a csv file the correct frontage length as well as the area of the block from the hatch.
